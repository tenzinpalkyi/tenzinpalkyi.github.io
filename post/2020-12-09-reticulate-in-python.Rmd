# Python and R Working Together

Reticulate is a really cool function that allows us to use two coding languages at the same time! In this blog post, we'll see how R and python can be used simultaneously for different functions.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggExtra)
```

For example, I have the iris dataset imported into python here:
```{python}
import seaborn as sns
df= sns.load_dataset('iris')

```

However, if I only like to make graphs using ggplot in R, then I can save the iris dataset (abbreviated to df) into R. To do this, I use the code py$"dataframename" and save that as the name I want in R. Then, I can use ggplot like I would in R studio to plot the variables of petal length and petal width. There seems to be a positive, linear relationship between these two variables, and the three species of irises are quite distinct from each other!
```{R}
df<-py$df

plot1<-ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(petal_length, petal_width, color= species))
plot1 + ggtitle("Iris Petal Length vs. Petal Width") + 
    xlab("Petal Length") + 
    ylab("Petal Width")
```

We can even do it the other way around, starting with a dataset imported in R. I'll import the ChickWeight dataset from R: 

```{R}
ChickWeight <- as.data.frame(ChickWeight)

```

A really simple piece of information we can get in python is the shape of this dataset. To call the dataset from R into python, all we need to do is add "r." in front of the dataset we're interested in. With the "shape" function, we see that there are 578 rows and 4 variables (columns). We can also find descriptive data about the weight variable, such as the mean, min, max, and standard deviation!
```{python}
r.ChickWeight.shape
r.ChickWeight.weight.describe()
```
