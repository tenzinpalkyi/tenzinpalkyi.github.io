# Python and R Working Together

Reticulate is a really cool function in R studio that allows us to use two coding languages at the same time! In this blog post, we'll see how R and python can be used simultaneously for different functions. 

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)
```

For example, I have the iris dataset imported into python here:
```{python}
import seaborn as sns
df= sns.load_dataset('iris')

```

However, if I only like to make graphs using ggplot in R, then I can save the iris dataset (abbreviated to df) into R. To do this, I use the code py$"dataframename" and save that as the nema I want in R. Then, I can use ggplot to plot the variables of petal length and petal width!
```{R}
df<-py$df

ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(petal_length, petal_width))

```


```{R}
ChickWeight <- as.data.frame(ChickWeight)

```

```{python}
r.ChickWeight.shape


```
